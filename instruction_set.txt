COMMANDS:

jumpifnil X
	if the top value on the stack == nil, jump to the label/instruction X
	DOES NOT CONSUME the stack

jumpiffalse X
	if the top value on the stack coerces to false (std.bool), jump to the label/instruction X
	DOES NOT CONSUME the stack

explode
	CONSUME the array on the top of the stack and PUSH all the sub-values back onto the stack

implode
	CONSUME N elements on the stack, merge them into an array, and PUSH the resulting number of elements onto the stack

jump X
	unconditionally jump to the label/instruction X
	DOES NOT CONSUME

add
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH (a + b)

sub
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH (a - b)

mult
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH (a * b)

div
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH (a / b)

remd
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH (a mod b)

booland, boolor, boolxor, inarray, strlike, equal, notequal, greater, greaterequal, less, lessequal
	CONSUME top 2 elements (a, b) from the stack and PUSH the result of the appropriate boolean operation

boolnot, varexists
	CONSUME the top element from the stack and PUSH the result of the appropriate boolean operation


OPCODES:
call
	run the given COMMAND
	(only consumes if the command specifies it does!)

label
	(This is an intermediate id to allow jumping between sections in the program: it does not exist in fully compiled bytecode)
	DOES NOT CONSUME, DOES NOT PUSH, DOES NOTHING

get
	read the value of the given variable (or null if it doesn't exist) and PUSH that value to the stack
	DOES NOT CONSUME

set
	CONSUME the first element from the stack and set as the given variable's value

push
	PUSH the given (constant) value onto the stack

pop
	CONSUME the top value from the stack and discard it

run_command
	CONSUME top element from the stack (MUST BE A STRING ARRAY) and executes the command. Note program execution will pause until the command returns.

push_cmd_result
	PUSH the result of the last executed command onto the stack. Will push null if no command was executed.
